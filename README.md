## Title: Audio Streaming Trends in 2020

### Team Members: Tracy Ammann, Rosaicela Roman, Amber Royster

Project Description/Outline:
- We are interested in looking at the trends of music genre streaming popularity over the course of the year in 2020 during a pandemic. We have selected 6 months analyze and will look at any changes over time during that month and how popularity with different genres are influenced by events occuring in the US. We will also look at unemployment insurance claims throughs the months selected and acertain any relationships with streaming numbers.

Research Questions to Answer:
- How does popularity change from genre as a general trend through the year and with specific months that correspond with sampled months?
- How do streaming numbers correspond with unemployment claims?

Datasets to Be Used:
- Spotify API and spotipy python library
- Spotify charts - pulled csv files containing historical streaming data for the top 200 and viral 50 songs 
- US department of labor - employment and training administration

Breakdown of Tasks:
- Tested APIs and major loops created.
- Each of us download csv files for 2 months.
- Work on the overall yearly trend together and then split the months up separately. 

### Notes to the graders

Each of us pulled and cleaned data for 2 months of each top 200 and viral 50 charts --- the data wrangling parts are in separate notebooks for each of us. The code for the collection notebooks will not run without entering your own ID and secert ID for the spotify API. 

We all worked on separate parts of the graphing and analysis and combined that into one jupyter notebook named "Graphing." This notebook is broken out into sections by name as well, but the code here is runable and the whole notebook is a compilation of how we approached creating our final graphs for the presentation.

Created csv files are stored in the 'csv files' folder and created/saved graphs are stored in the 'Images' folder.
